# Is the Concept of Autocity Scary?

The Autocity project, envisioning an equal society without money, may invoke fear or apprehension. This document explores these emotions, taking into account the historical context of capitalism, socialism, and communism.

## The Transition from Capitalism to Socialism to Communism

Understanding the differences between these ideologies is crucial for appreciating the Autocity concept.

### Capitalism

- Rewards individual effort and innovation
- Can lead to significant disparities in wealth

### Socialism

- Aims for equality and shared resources
- Often fails to provide the perfect balance between individual and collective needs

### Communism

- Seeks a classless society where all property is publicly owned
- Historically, attempts to implement communism have led to authoritarian regimes and economic challenges

## Do We Want an Equal Society?

This question is central to Autocity. Different perspectives may arise:

### Desire for Perfect Equality

- A vision of a perfectly democratic society
- Autocity as a step toward this ideal

### Rejection of Perfect Equality

- A belief in the right to have more than others
- Autocity may not align with this viewpoint

### Desire for Equal Starting Opportunities

- A wish for equal access to food, water, housing, and education
- Autocity argues that this alone is insufficient due to the changing job market and potential for unequal outcomes

## The Fear of Utopia

Rebuilding society from the ground up may seem like an unattainable utopia. This can induce fear, especially considering the historical failures of communism. However, is this fear justified, or is the current system's inability to achieve true equality even more frightening?

## Conclusion

The Autocity project challenges conventional societal structures, and yes, it can be scary. But fear should not stifle innovation or the pursuit of ideals. By understanding the historical context and considering the failings and successes of capitalism, socialism, and communism, we can engage in a more nuanced discussion.

What do you think? Are you afraid of the concept, or are you excited about the possibilities it could bring?

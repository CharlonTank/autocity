# What is Autocity?
Autocity project goal is to gather information to know how much people and resource we need to create an autonomous city with a society without money and perfect equality with equity between people, controlled by its people using global democracy.

# Steps
First, we need to define each step.
There is to big steps :
1) What do we need before the first seed.
2) What do we need to be sure to launch a seed. Resources, people, places... etc

# People
To launch a seed, we need to find the minimum number of matching skills people in each domain, from mathematician, to manager, to mechanician, to cook, to teachers, to lawyers, etc... most of them with their family so that they can be loved and grow within the seed.
How much developer do we need? How much farmer? How much teacher? In what domain?

# Resources
To launch a seed, we need to know how much resource we need from the beginning to total automation.

# Places
We need places to begin, the best way by far is to contact mayors of socialists cities in places where there is space/room to begin the project

# Work and money
For now, work on this has no direct rewards, because this is pretty much time donation.
Once we launch the first seed, people in that seed will have a lot to accomplish to maintain the seed.
In our modern capitalist society, we have less and less jobs, so we keep and create jobs just to keep people working, producing more pollution... Programmed obsolescence is everywhere... So in our modern capitalist society, goal of work is to earn money for ourselves and our family, giving more money to big companies for most of us, digging the distance between rich and poor people even more, everyday...
The goal of work in a seed is not about earning money, neither creating value for big companies, the goal of work is to reduce the time of work day by day until perfect automation is reach.
Since everything can be voted out, the number of work hours at the beginning will be voted, it may vary a bit. But since we will work to reduce work time.

# Can I contribute?
Doing this project without any contribution is not possible.
We need people in each domain to know exactly what we need to launch a seed

# Seed
What I call a seed is a city try created by Autocity's community.
Imagine in the near future, we find out that we need 1000 people to begin.
After some time, 1000 people with matching skills are ready to give a try and we find a place to begin.
There is a chance it works, there is a chance it fails, in any case, we can call one try a seed since it may grow.

# Do you find this scary?
Well, of course this is scary... but look : we always switch from capitalism to socialism, right? Why? Because we want to be equal to other but when we work a lot to create amazing things, we want to keep it for our family before sharing it to others, that induce power/money/poverty/capitalism. Socialism is a hotfix for capitalism but it never worked perfectly...
The question is : Do we want an equal society? Meaning a perfect democracy? If so, this can be a good step.
If you think : No I want to be able to have more than other, this project is not for you. If you think : I'm not asking for perfect equality because it too much of an utopia, I'm asking people to have the same luck at the beginning of their life, meaning food, water, home for everybody and the right to learn and to earn life by working... I must answer, this is not possible, we all know there is less and less jobs, if everybody begin their life with the same level, some will be luckier or/and will work more to get better jobs and they will actually win more money than most, doing so, they will have more money, more money for some mean less money for others, meaning poverty...
Beginning with the same chances are not enough, we need to rebuild a society, Thinking a rebuild of the society is too much of an utopia is even more scary...

# Future
Let's see how far this project can go

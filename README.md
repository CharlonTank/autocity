# What is Autocity?

Autocity is a pioneering project that envisions the establishment of an autonomous city. Unlike conventional cities, this ambitious concept seeks to abolish monetary systems and create a society founded on perfect equality and equity. The governing structure would be controlled by the citizens themselves through a model of global democracy.

The idea of an autonomous city goes beyond just self-sufficiency in resources. It represents a profound shift in social structure, where the goal is to ensure that every individual starts life with the same opportunities. This is not a mere idealistic dream; it's a response to the growing disparities between rich and poor and the reduction of jobs in modern capitalist societies.

Programmed obsolescence, the creation of jobs merely to keep people working, and the increasing gap between the rich and the poor are pressing concerns. Autocity challenges these issues by promoting a new societal construct that focuses on human values rather than economic gain. Work in Autocity isn't about earning money or creating value for large corporations. Instead, it is about reducing the time of work day by day until perfect automation is reached.

Through collaboration, careful planning, and the engagement of various skill sets, Autocity aims to build a city from a seed - an initial attempt that may grow if successful. It's a project that may be deemed utopian by some, but it raises essential questions about our values and the kind of society we wish to live in.

In a world where we often switch between capitalism and socialism, Autocity asks: Do we want an equal society? Do we believe in perfect democracy? If so, this could be a step towards that future.

## Steps

First, we need to define each step. There are two major stages:

What we need before planting the first seed.
What we need to ensure the launch of a seed. This includes resources, people, places, etc.
People
To launch a seed, we need to find the minimum number of people with matching skills in various domains, from mathematicians to managers, mechanics, cooks, teachers, lawyers, etc., most of them with their families so that they can be loved and grow within the seed. How many developers, farmers, teachers do we need? In what domains?

## Resources

To launch a seed, we need to know how many resources we need from the beginning to total automation.

## Places

We need places to begin. The best way by far is to contact the mayors of socialist cities in areas where there is space to initiate the project.

## Work and Money

For now, working on this project has no direct rewards, as it involves time donation. Once we launch the first seed, people in that seed will have much to accomplish to maintain it. In our modern capitalist society, we have fewer and fewer jobs, so we create jobs just to keep people working, producing more pollution. Programmed obsolescence is everywhere. In our modern capitalist society, the goal of work is to earn money for ourselves and our families, giving more money to large companies, increasing the gap between rich and poor. The goal of work in a seed is to reduce working hours day by day until perfect automation is reached. Since everything can be voted out, the number of work hours at the beginning will be decided by vote, and since we will work to reduce working time, work time will decrease.

## Can I Contribute?

Doing this project without contributions is not possible. We need people in each domain to know exactly what we need to launch a seed.

# Seed

What I call a seed is a city trial created by Autocity's community. Imagine in the near future, we find out that we need 1000 people to begin. After some time, 1000 people with matching skills are ready to give it a try, and we find a place to begin. There is a chance it works, and there is a chance it fails; in any case, we can call one attempt a seed since it may grow.

# Do You Find This Scary?

Well, of course, this is scary, but look: we always switch between capitalism and socialism, right? Why? Because we want to be equal to others, but when we work a lot to create amazing things, we want to keep them for our family before sharing with others, inducing power/money/poverty/capitalism. Socialism is a hotfix for capitalism, but it never worked perfectly. The question is: Do we want an equal society, meaning a perfect democracy? If so, this can be a good step. If you think, "No, I want to have more than others," this project is not for you. If you think, "I'm not asking for perfect equality because it's too much of a utopia; I'm asking for people to have the same chances at the beginning of their lives, meaning food, water, shelter for everybody, and the right to learn and earn life by working," I must answer that this is not possible. We all know there are fewer and fewer jobs; if everyone begins life at the same level, some will be luckier or work harder to get better jobs and will win more money than most. Doing so, they will have more money, meaning poverty for others. Beginning with the same chances is not enough; we need to rebuild society. Thinking that rebuilding society is too much of a utopia is even more scary.

# Future

Let's see how far this project can go.

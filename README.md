# Autocity
Autocity project goal is to gather information to know how much people and resource we need to create an autonomous city with a society without money and perfect equality between people, controlled by its people using global democracy.

# Steps
First, we need to define each step

# Can I contribute?
Doing this project withour any contribution is not possible.
We need people in each domain to know exactly what we need to launch a seed

# Seed
What I call a seed is a potential city created by Autocity's community.
Imagine in the near future, we find out that we need 1000 people to begin.
After some time, 1000 people with matching skills are ready to give a try and we find a place to begin.
Maybe it would work, but maybe it would fail, but this is still a seed.

# Future
Let's see how far this project can go

# The Seed in Autocity

The concept of a "seed" is central to the Autocity project, symbolizing the initial attempt to create an autonomous city. This document explores what a seed means, the requirements for its initiation, and the potential it holds for growth.

## What is a Seed?

In the context of Autocity, a seed is a trial city created by the community. It represents an initial attempt to build a self-sufficient, autonomous city governed by its people.

## Requirements for a Seed

To initiate a seed, several components must come together:

### 1. People

- A minimum number of individuals with matching skills, including mathematicians, developers, farmers, teachers, lawyers, etc.
- Inclusion of families to foster a sense of community

### 2. Resources

- Essential resources to support the seed from inception to total automation
- Includes technological infrastructure, food supply, housing, and more

### 3. Places

- Selection of a suitable location conducive to the project's success
- Collaboration with local authorities may be necessary

### 4. Work and Money Philosophy

- Structured work focusing on reducing work time until total automation
- A departure from traditional capitalist work ethics

## Potential for Growth or Failure

Each seed is an experiment with the potential to grow into a flourishing autonomous city or fail. Both outcomes offer valuable insights:

### Success

- A successful seed may become a blueprint for future autonomous cities
- It will showcase the practicality of a society free from money and built on equity

### Failure

- Failure offers opportunities for learning and refinement
- Understanding what went wrong helps in making informed adjustments for future attempts

## Conclusion

The seed in Autocity is not just a metaphor but a tangible step toward a new kind of society. It represents a bold attempt to challenge conventional city structures and economic systems. Whether a seed grows or fails, it contributes to the ongoing exploration of a more equal and human-centric world.

Are you ready to be part of a seed? Your skills, passion, and vision could be instrumental in making this utopian dream a reality.
